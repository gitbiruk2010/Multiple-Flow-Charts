A hypothetical software development project for a Fitness Tracker App that integrates wearable device data, workout tracking, and user analytics. This repository documents the project's flowcharts, architecture, and development lifecycle.

---

## Project Overview
The Fitness Tracker App enables users to:
- Track daily steps, heart rate, and calories burned.
- Sync data with wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch).
- View personalized workout recommendations.
- Analyze fitness progress through interactive dashboards.

## Flowcharts

### 1. **Basic Flow Chart (SDLC Overview)**
- **Purpose**: High-level view of the software development lifecycle.
- **Flow**:  
  `Start → Requirement Gathering → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → End`  
- **Key Insight**: Linear phases highlight core milestones but exclude iterative feedback loops.

### 2. **System Flow Chart (Architecture)**
- **Purpose**: Illustrate component interactions.  
- **Flow**:  
  `Mobile App → API Gateway → Backend Server → Database`  
  `Wearable Devices → External APIs (Google Fit/Apple HealthKit)`  
- **Key Insight**: API Gateway scalability is critical for handling user data synchronization.

### 3. **Workflow Diagram (Feature Development)**
- **Purpose**: Map roles and tasks for feature implementation (e.g., "Sleep Tracking").  
- **Flow**:  
  `Product Manager → Designer → Developer → QA → DevOps`  
- **Key Insight**: Delays in design handoffs can block development progress.

### 4. **Data Flow Chart**
- **Purpose**: Track fitness data from collection to storage.  
- **Flow**:  
  `Wearable Device → Mobile App → Backend → Database → Analytics Dashboard`  
- **Key Insight**: Data encryption at the API Gateway ensures user privacy.

### 5. **Decision Flow Chart (User Interaction)**
- **Purpose**: Model conditional logic (e.g., workout recommendations).  
- **Flow**:
